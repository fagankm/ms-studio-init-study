# ms-studio-init-study

The ms-studio-init-study project is an in-depth analysis of the movie industry, with a focus on helping a theoretical new movie studio succeed in a highly competitive market. The project utilizes data from two sources: IMDB.com, which provides information on movies such as title, release date, language, and genres; and The-Numbers.com, which provides financial data on movies such as production budget, domestic gross, worldwide gross, and profit.

The project is organized into two main components: the Jupyter notebook ms_studio_study.ipynb and the summary report ms_new_studio.pdf. The Jupyter notebook contains all of the data manipulations and visualizations that were performed during the course of the study. The summary report, on the other hand, provides a concise overview of the key findings and recommendations for the new movie studio.

The Jupyter notebook begins by importing the necessary libraries and loading the data into a pandas DataFrame. From there, the data is cleaned and manipulated in order to answer a series of research questions. The notebook also includes a variety of visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts, to help make the findings more clear and understandable.

The summary report, ms_new_studio.pdf, takes the key findings from the Jupyter notebook and presents them in an easy-to-digest format. It includes information on the most profitable genres, the most successful directors, and the best languages to produce movies in. It also includes recommendations for the new movie studio based on the findings, such as which genres to focus on and which languages to produce movies in.

region_explore.ipynb is in progress awaiting more specific regional movie performance data.
